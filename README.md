# 🔑 **Python Keylogger with Advanced Features** 🔑

## 📖 **Overview**
This project is a Python-based keylogger designed for **educational and ethical purposes only**. It demonstrates how keylogging works while integrating additional features like screenshot capturing and email-based reporting. The project also allows users to compile the keylogger as a standalone executable.

## 🚀 **Features**
- **Keystroke Logging**: Captures all keystrokes and logs them into a JSON file categorized by active applications.
- **Screenshot Capturing**: Periodically captures screenshots and stores them locally.
- **Email Reporting**: Sends both key logs and screenshots to a specified email at regular intervals.
- **Standalone Executable**: Runs as a compiled `.exe` file for ease of use and background operation.
- **No Remote Server**: Unlike other implementations, this keylogger does not rely on a remote server, ensuring local storage and minimal dependencies.

## 📦 **Installation Guide**
# **Option 1: Running the Python Script**
1. **Clone the Repository**
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python-Keylogger.git
cd Python-Keylogger
```

2. **Set up a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
-Create a .env file in the root directory:
```plaintext
EMAIL_SENDER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
EMAIL_RECEIVER=receiver-email@gmail.com
```
-Replace placeholders with your actual credentials.

5. **Run the Keylogger**
```bash
python keylogger.py
```

## **Option 2: Running the Compiled Executable**
1. **Compile the Python script into an executable file using pyinstaller:**
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole keylogger.py
```
-The executable will be located in the dist/ folder.

2. **Test the .exe File**
-Run the executable file by double-clicking it.
-It will log keystrokes and capture screenshots as per your settings.
<br>

## ✨ **Usage Instructions**
1. **Keylogger Output**
   - Keystrokes are logged in `key_log.json`, categorized by application.
   - Screenshots are saved in the `screenshots/` folder.
2. **Email Reporting**
   - Emails are sent at regular intervals (default: 5 minutes) to the specified email.
   - Logs and screenshots are attached to the email.
3. **Stopping the Keylogger**
   - Press the `ESC` key in any application to stop the keylogger.
<br>

## 📜 **Installation of the Keylogger via USB (Optional)**
1. Copy the compiled `.exe` file onto a USB drive.
2. On the target system, run the `.exe` to activate the keylogger.
3. The keylogger will run silently in the background.

> **Note**: Auto-run from USB is restricted in modern systems due to security protocols. This method requires manual execution.
<br>

# ⚙️ Customization Options

1. Adjust Logging and Screenshot Intervals 
   Modify the following constants in `keylogger.py`:
   ```python
   EMAIL_INTERVAL = 300  # Time in seconds (default: 5 minutes)
   SCREENSHOT_INTERVAL = 60  # Time in seconds (default: 1 minute)
2. Change Email Credentials
Update the .env file with new credentials as needed.
3. Disable Email Reporting
Comment out or remove the send_email() function in the script.
